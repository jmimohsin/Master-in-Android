**History of Java**
===================

**Java history** is interesting to know. Java team members (also known
as **Green Team**), initiated a revolutionary task to develop a language for
digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions etc.

For the green team members, it was an advance concept at that time. But, it was
suited for internet programming. Later, Java technology as incorporated by
Netscape.

Currently, Java is used in internet programming, mobile devices, games,
e-business solutions etc. There are given the major points that describes the
history of java.

1) **James Gosling**, **Mike Sheridan**, and **Patrick Naughton** initiated the
Java language project in June 1991. The small team of sun engineers
called **Green Team**.

2) Originally designed for small, embedded systems in electronic appliances like
set-top boxes.

3) Firstly, it was called **"Greentalk"** by James Gosling and file extension
was .gt.

4) After that, it was called **Oak** and was developed as a part of the Green
project.

7) **Why they choosed java name for java language?** The team gathered to choose
a new name. The suggested words were "dynamic", "revolutionary", "Silk", "jolt",
"DNA" etc. They wanted something that reflected the essence of the technology:
revolutionary, dynamic, lively, cool, unique, and easy to spell and fun to say.

According to James Gosling "Java was one of the top choices along
with **Silk**". Since java was so unique, most of the team members preferred
java.

8) Java is an island of Indonesia where first coffee was produced (called java
coffee).

9) Notice that Java is just a name not an acronym.

10) Originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which is now a
subsidiary of Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995.

11) In 1995, Time magazine called **Java one of the Ten Best Products of 1995**.

12) JDK 1.0 released in(January 23, 1996).
