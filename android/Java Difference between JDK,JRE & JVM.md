**Difference between JDK, JRE and JVM**
=======================================

 

Understanding the difference between JDK, JRE and JVM is important in Java. We
are having brief overview of JVM here.

If you want to get the detailed knowledge of Java Virtural Machine, move to the
next page. Firstly, let's see the basic differences between the JDK, JRE and
JVM.

 

**JVM**
-------

JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is a specification that
provides runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed.

JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms. JVM, JRE and JDK
are platform dependent because configuration of each OS differs. But, Java is
platform independent.

The JVM performs following main tasks:

-   Loads code

-   Verifies code

-   Executes code

-   Provides runtime environment

 

**JRE**
-------

JRE is an acronym for Java Runtime Environment.It is used to provide runtime
environment.It is the implementation of JVM.It physically exists.It contains set
of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.

Implementation of JVMs are also actively released by other companies besides Sun
Micro Systems.

 

**JDK**
-------

JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit.It physically exists.It contains JRE
+ development tools.
