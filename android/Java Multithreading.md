**Java Multithreading**
=======================

Java is a*multithreaded programming language* which means we can develop
multithreaded program using Java. A multithreaded program contains two or more
parts that can run concurrently and each part can handle different task at the
same time making optimal use of the available resources specially when your
computer has multiple CPUs.

By definition multitasking is when multiple processes share common processing
resources such as a CPU. Multithreading extends the idea of multitasking into
applications where you can subdivide specific operations within a single
application into individual threads. Each of the threads can run in parallel.
The OS divides processing time not only among different applications, but also
among each thread within an application.

Multithreading enables you to write in a way where multiple activities can
proceed concurrently in the same program.

**Life Cycle of a Thread:**
---------------------------

A thread goes through various stages in its life cycle. For example, a thread is
born, started, runs, and then dies. Following diagram shows complete life cycle
of a thread.

![Java Thread](file:///D:/Mohsin/assets/assets/img/Multithreading_files.jpg)

Above-mentioned stages are explained here:

-   **New:** A new thread begins its life cycle in the new state. It remains in
    this state until the program starts the thread. It is also referred to as a
    born thread.

-   **Runnable:** After a newly born thread is started, the thread becomes
    runnable. A thread in this state is considered to be executing its task.

-   **Waiting:** Sometimes, a thread transitions to the waiting state while the
    thread waits for another thread to perform a task.A thread transitions back
    to the runnable state only when another thread signals the waiting thread to
    continue executing.

-   **Timed waiting:** A runnable thread can enter the timed waiting state for a
    specified interval of time. A thread in this state transitions back to the
    runnable state when that time interval expires or when the event it is
    waiting for occurs.

-   **Terminated:** A runnable thread enters the terminated state when it
    completes its task or otherwise terminates.

**Thread Priorities:**
----------------------

Every Java thread has a priority that helps the operating system determine the
order in which threads are scheduled.

Java thread priorities are in the range between MIN_PRIORITY (a constant of 1)
and MAX_PRIORITY (a constant of 10). By default, every thread is given priority
NORM_PRIORITY (a constant of 5).

Threads with higher priority are more important to a program and should be
allocated processor time before lower-priority threads. However, thread
priorities cannot guarantee the order in which threads execute and very much
platform dependentant.

**Create Thread by Implementing Runnable Interface:**
-----------------------------------------------------

If your class is intended to be executed as a thread then you can achieve this
by implementing **Runnable** interface. You will need to follow three basic
steps:

**Step 1:**
-----------

As a first step you need to implement a run() method provided by **Runnable**
interface. This method provides entry point for the thread and you will put you
complete business logic inside this method. Following is simple syntax of run()
method:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
public void run( )
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Step 2:**
-----------

At second step you will instantiate a **Thread** object using the following
constructor:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Thread(Runnable threadObj, String threadName);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Where, *threadObj* is an instance of a class that implements the **Runnable**
interface and **threadName** is the name given to the new thread.

**Step 3**
----------

Once Thread object is created, you can start it by calling **start( )** method,
which executes a call to run( ) method. Following is simple syntax of start()
method:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
void start( );
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### **Example:**

Here is an example that creates a new thread and starts it running:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
class RunnableDemo implements Runnable {
   private Thread t;
   private String threadName;
  
   RunnableDemo( String name){
       threadName = name;
       System.out.println("Creating " +  threadName );
   }
   public void run() {
      System.out.println("Running " +  threadName );
      try {
         for(int i = 4; i > 0; i--) {
            System.out.println("Thread: " + threadName + ", " + i);
            // Let the thread sleep for a while.
            Thread.sleep(50);
         }
     } catch (InterruptedException e) {
         System.out.println("Thread " +  threadName + " interrupted.");
     }
     System.out.println("Thread " +  threadName + " exiting.");
   }
  
   public void start ()
   {
      System.out.println("Starting " +  threadName );
      if (t == null)
      {
         t = new Thread (this, threadName);
         t.start ();
      }
   }
 
}
 
public class TestThread {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
  
      RunnableDemo R1 = new RunnableDemo( "Thread-1");
      R1.start();
     
      RunnableDemo R2 = new RunnableDemo( "Thread-2");
      R2.start();
   }  
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This would produce the following result:

Creating Thread-1

Starting Thread-1

Creating Thread-2

Starting Thread-2

Running Thread-1

Thread: Thread-1, 4

Running Thread-2

Thread: Thread-2, 4

Thread: Thread-1, 3

Thread: Thread-2, 3

Thread: Thread-1, 2

Thread: Thread-2, 2

Thread: Thread-1, 1

Thread: Thread-2, 1

Thread Thread-1 exiting.

Thread Thread-2 exiting.

**Create Thread by Extending Thread Class:**
--------------------------------------------

The second way to create a thread is to create a new class that extends
**Thread** class using the following two simple steps. This approach provides
more flexibility in handling multiple threads created using available methods in
Thread class.

**Step 1**
----------

You will need to override **run( )** method available in Thread class. This
method provides entry point for the thread and you will put you complete
business logic inside this method. Following is simple syntax of run() method:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
public void run( )
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Step 2**
----------

Once Thread object is created, you can start it by calling **start( )** method,
which executes a call to run( ) method. Following is simple syntax of start()
method:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
void start( );
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### **Example:**

Here is the preceding program rewritten to extend Thread:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
class ThreadDemo extends Thread {
   private Thread t;
   private String threadName;
  
   ThreadDemo( String name){
       threadName = name;
       System.out.println("Creating " +  threadName );
   }
   public void run() {
      System.out.println("Running " +  threadName );
      try {
         for(int i = 4; i > 0; i--) {
            System.out.println("Thread: " + threadName + ", " + i);
            // Let the thread sleep for a while.
            Thread.sleep(50);
         }
     } catch (InterruptedException e) {
         System.out.println("Thread " +  threadName + " interrupted.");
     }
     System.out.println("Thread " +  threadName + " exiting.");
   }
  
   public void start ()
   {
      System.out.println("Starting " +  threadName );
      if (t == null)
      {
         t = new Thread (this, threadName);
         t.start ();
      }
   }
 
}
 
public class TestThread {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
  
      ThreadDemo T1 = new ThreadDemo( "Thread-1");
      T1.start();
      
      ThreadDemo T2 = new ThreadDemo( "Thread-2");
      T2.start();
   }  
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This would produce the following result:

Creating Thread-1

Starting Thread-1

Creating Thread-2

Starting Thread-2

Running Thread-1

Thread: Thread-1, 4

Running Thread-2

Thread: Thread-2, 4

Thread: Thread-1, 3

Thread: Thread-2, 3

Thread: Thread-1, 2

Thread: Thread-2, 2

Thread: Thread-1, 1

Thread: Thread-2, 1

Thread Thread-1 exiting.

Thread Thread-2 exiting.

**Example:**

The following ThreadClassDemo program demonstrates some of these methods of the
Thread class. Consider a class **DisplayMessage** which implements **Runnable**:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// File Name : DisplayMessage.java
// Create a thread to implement Runnable
public class DisplayMessage implements Runnable
{
   private String message;
   public DisplayMessage(String message)
   {
      this.message = message;
   }
   public void run()
   {
      while(true)
      {
         System.out.println(message);
      }
   }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following is another class which extends Thread class:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// File Name : GuessANumber.java
// Create a thread to extentd Thread
public class GuessANumber extends Thread
{
   private int number;
   public GuessANumber(int number)
   {
      this.number = number;
   }
   public void run()
   {
      int counter = 0;
      int guess = 0;
      do
      {
          guess = (int) (Math.random() * 100 + 1);
          System.out.println(this.getName()
                       + " guesses " + guess);
          counter++;
      }while(guess != number);
      System.out.println("** Correct! " + this.getName()
                       + " in " + counter + " guesses.**");
   }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following is the main program which makes use of above defined classes:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// File Name : ThreadClassDemo.java
public class ThreadClassDemo

   public static void main(String [] args)
   {
      Runnable hello = new DisplayMessage("Hello");
      Thread thread1 = new Thread(hello);
      thread1.setDaemon(true);
      thread1.setName("hello");
      System.out.println("Starting hello thread...");
      thread1.start();
     
      Runnable bye = new DisplayMessage("Goodbye");
      Thread thread2 = new Thread(bye);
      thread2.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY);
