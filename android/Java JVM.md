**JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**
==============================

    JVM](http://www.javatpoint.com/internal-details-of-jvm#jvminternalarch)

JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is a specification that
provides runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed.

JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms (i.e.JVM is
plateform dependent).

**What is JVM?**
----------------

It is:

1.  **A specification** where working of Java Virtual Machine is specified. But
    implementation provider is independent to choose the algorithm. Its
    implementation has been provided by Sun and other companies.

2.  **An implementation** Its implementation is known as JRE (Java Runtime
    Environment).

3.  **Runtime Instance** Whenever you write java command on the command prompt
    to run the java class, and instance of JVM is created.

**What it does?**
-----------------

### **The JVM performs following operation:**

-   Loads code

-   Verifies code

-   Executes code

-   Provides runtime environment

### **JVM provides definitions for the:**

-   Memory area

-   Class file format

-   Register set

-   Garbage-collected heap

-   Fatal error reporting etc.

**Internal Architecture of JVM**
--------------------------------

Let's understand the internal architecture of JVM. It contains classloader,
memory area, execution engine etc.

### **1) Classloader:**

Classloader is a subsystem of JVM that is used to load class files.

### **2) Class(Method) Area:**

Class(Method) Area stores per-class structures such as the runtime constant
pool, field and method data, the code for methods.

### **3) Heap:**

It is the runtime data area in which objects are allocated.

### **4) Stack:**

Java Stack stores frames. It holds local variables and partial results, and
plays a part in method invocation and return.

Each thread has a private JVM stack, created at the same time as thread.

A new frame is created each time a method is invoked. A frame is destroyed when
its method invocation completes.

### **5) Program Counter Register:**

PC (program counter) register. It contains the address of the Java virtual
machine instruction currently being executed.

### **6) Native Method Stack:**

It contains all the native methods used in the application.

### **7) Execution Engine:**

It contains:

**1) A virtual processor**

**2) Interpreter:Read** bytecode stream then execute the instructions.

**3) Just-In-Time(JIT) compiler:It** is used to improve the performance.JIT
compiles parts of the byte code that have similar functionality at the same
time, and hence reduces the amount of time needed for compilation.Here the term
?compiler? refers to a translator from the instruction set of a Java virtual
machine (JVM) to the instruction set of a specific CPU.
