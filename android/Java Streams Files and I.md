**Java Streams Files and I/O**
==============================

The java.io package contains nearly every class you might ever need to perform
input and output (I/O) in Java. All these streams represent an input source and
an output destination. The stream in the java.io package supports many data such
as primitives, Object, localized characters, etc.

A stream can be defined as a sequence of data. The InputStream is used to read
data from a source and the OutputStream is used for writing data to a
destination.

Java provides strong but flexible support for I/O related to Files and networks
but this tutorial covers very basic functionality related to streams and I/O. We
would see most commonly used example one by one:

**Byte Streams**
----------------

Java byte streams are used to perform input and output of 8-bit bytes. Though
there are many classes related to byte streams but the most frequently used
classes are , **FileInputStream** and **FileOutputStream**. Following is an
example which makes use of these two classes to copy an input file into an
output file:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
import java.io.*;
 
public class CopyFile {
   public static void main(String args[]) throws IOException
   {
      FileInputStream in = null;
      FileOutputStream out = null;
 
      try {
         in = new FileInputStream("input.txt");
         out = new FileOutputStream("output.txt");
        
         int c;
         while ((c = in.read()) != -1) {
            out.write(c);
         }
      }finally {
         if (in != null) {
            in.close();
         }
         if (out != null) {
            out.close();
         }
      }
   }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now let's have a file **input.txt** with the following content:

This is test for copy file.

As a next step, compile above program and execute it, which will result in
creating output.txt file with the same content as we have in input.txt. So let's
put above code in CopyFile.java file and do the following:

\$javac CopyFile.java

\$java CopyFile

**Character Streams**
---------------------

Java **Byte** streams are used to perform input and output of 8-bit bytes, where
as Java **Character** streams are used to perform input and output for 16-bit
unicode. Though there are many classes related to character streams but the most
frequently used classes are , **FileReader**  and **FileWriter.**. Though
internally FileReader uses FileInputStream and FileWriter uses FileOutputStream
but here major difference is that FileReader reads two bytes at a time and
FileWriter writes two bytes at a time.

We can re-write above example which makes use of these two classes to copy an
input file (having unicode characters) into an output file:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
import java.io.*;
 
public class CopyFile {
   public static void main(String args[]) throws IOException
   {
      FileReader in = null;
      FileWriter out = null;
 
      try {
         in = new FileReader("input.txt");
         out = new FileWriter("output.txt");
        
         int c;
         while ((c = in.read()) != -1) {
            out.write(c);
         }
      }finally {
         if (in != null) {
            in.close();
         }
         if (out != null) {
            out.close();
         }
      }
   } 
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now let's have a file **input.txt** with the following content:

This is test for copy file.

As a next step, compile above program and execute it, which will result in
creating output.txt file with the same content as we have in input.txt. So let's
put above code in CopyFile.java file and do the following:

\$javac CopyFile.java

\$java CopyFile

**Standard Streams**
--------------------

All the programming languages provide support for standard I/O where user's
program can take input from a keyboard and then produce output on the computer
screen. If you are aware if C or C++ programming languages, then you must be
aware of three standard devices STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR. Similar way Java
provides following three standard streams

-   **Standard Input:** This is used to feed the data to user's program and
    usually a keyboard is used as standard input stream and represented as
    **System.in**.

-   **Standard Output:** This is used to output the data produced by the user's
    program and usually a computer screen is used to standard output stream and
    represented as **System.out**.

-   **Standard Error:** This is used to output the error data produced by the
    user's program and usually a computer screen is used to standard error
    stream and represented as **System.err**.

Following is a simple program which creates **InputStreamReader** to read
standard input stream until the user types a "q":

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
import java.io.*;
 
public class ReadConsole {
   public static void main(String args[]) throws IOException
   {
      InputStreamReader cin = null;
 
      try {
         cin = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
         System.out.println("Enter characters, 'q' to quit.");
         char c;
         do {
            c = (char) cin.read();
            System.out.print(c);
         } while(c != 'q');
      }finally {
         if (cin != null) {
            cin.close();
         }
      }
   }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's keep above code in ReadConsole.java file and try to compile and execute it
as below. This program continues reading and outputting same character until we
press 'q':

\$javac ReadConsole.java

\$java ReadConsole

Enter characters, 'q' to quit.

1

1

e

e

q

q

**Reading and Writing Files:**
------------------------------

As described earlier, A stream can be defined as a sequence of data. The
**InputStream** is used to read data from a source and the **OutputStream** is
used for writing data to a destination.

Here is a hierarchy of classes to deal with Input and Output streams.

![Java I/O Streams](file:///D:/Mohsin/assets/assets/img/Streams_Files.jpg)

The two important streams are **FileInputStream** and **FileOutputStream**,
which would be discussed in this tutorial:

**FileInputStream:**
--------------------

This stream is used for reading data from the files. Objects can be created
using the keyword new and there are several types of constructors available.

Following constructor takes a file name as a string to create an input stream
object to read the file.:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
InputStream f = new FileInputStream("C:/java/hello");
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following constructor takes a file object to create an input stream object to
read the file. First we create a file object using File() method as follows:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File f = new File("C:/java/hello");
InputStream f = new FileInputStream(f);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have *InputStream* object in hand, then there is a list of helper
methods which can be used to read to stream or to do other operations on the
stream.

Â 

There are other important input streams available, for more detail you can refer
to the following links:

-   ByteArrayInputStream

-   DataInputStream

**FileOutputStream:**
---------------------

FileOutputStream is used to create a file and write data into it. The stream
would create a file, if it doesn't already exist, before opening it for output.

Here are two constructors which can be used to create a FileOutputStream object.

Following constructor takes a file name as a string to create an input stream
object to write the file:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OutputStream f = new FileOutputStream("C:/java/hello")
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following constructor takes a file object to create an output stream object to
write the file. First, we create a file object using File() method as follows:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
File f = new File("C:/java/hello");
OutputStream f = new FileOutputStream(f);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have *OutputStream* object in hand, then there is a list of helper
methods, which can be used to write to stream or to do other operations on the
stream.

Â 

There are other important output streams available, for more detail you can
refer to the following links:

-   ByteArrayOutputStream

-   DataOutputStream

**Example:**
------------

Following is the example to demonstrate InputStream and OutputStream:

Â 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
import java.io.*;
 
public class fileStreamTest{
 
   public static void main(String args[]){
  
   try{
      byte bWrite [] = {11,21,3,40,5};
      OutputStream os = new FileOutputStream("test.txt");
      for(int x=0; x < bWrite.length ; x++){
         os.write( bWrite[x] ); // writes the bytes
      }
      os.close();
    
      InputStream is = new FileInputStream("test.txt");
      int size = is.available();
 
      for(int i=0; i< size; i++){
         System.out.print((char)is.read() + "  ");
      }
      is.close();
   }catch(IOException e){
      System.out.print("Exception");
   }   
   }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The above code would create file test.txt and would write given numbers in
binary format. Same would be output on the stdout screen.

**File Navigation and I/O:**
----------------------------

There are several other classes that we would be going through to get to know
the basics of File Navigation and I/O.

-   File Class

-   FileReader Class

-   FileWriter Class

**Directories in Java:**
------------------------

A directory is a File which can contains a list of other files and directories.
You use **File** object to create directories, to list down files available in a
directory. For complete detail check a list of all the methods which you can
call on File object and what are related to directories.

**Creating Directories:**
-------------------------

There are two useful **File** utility methods, which can be used to create
directories:

-   The **mkdir( )** method creates a directory, returning true on success and
    false on failure. Failure indicates that the path specified in the File
    object already exists, or that the directory cannot be created because the
    entire path does not exist yet.

-   The **mkdirs()** method creates both a directory and all the parents of the
    directory.

Following example creates "/tmp/user/java/bin" directory:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
import java.io.File;
 
public class CreateDir {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      String dirname = "/tmp/user/java/bin";
      File d = new File(dirname);
      // Create directory now.
      d.mkdirs();
  }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compile and execute above code to create "/tmp/user/java/bin".

**Note:** Java automatically takes care of path separators on UNIX and Windows
as per conventions. If you use a forward slash (/) on a Windows version of Java,
the path will still resolve correctly.

**Listing Directories:**
------------------------

You can use **list( )** method provided by **File** object to list down all the
files and directories available in a directory as follows:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
import java.io.File;
 
public class ReadDir {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
     
      File file = null;
      String[] paths;
           
      try{     
         // create new file object
         file = new File("/tmp");
                                
         // array of files and directory
         paths = file.list();
           
         // for each name in the path array
         for(String path:paths)
         {
            // prints filename and directory name
            System.out.println(path);
         }
      }catch(Exception e){
         // if any error occurs
         e.printStackTrace();
      }
   }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This would produce following result based on the directories and files available
in your **/tmp** directory:

test1.txt

test2.txt

ReadDir.java

ReadDir.class
