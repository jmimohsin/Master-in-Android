**Java Modifier Types**
=======================

Modifiers are keywords that you add to those definitions to change their
meanings. The Java language has a wide variety of modifiers, including the
following:

-   Java Access Modifiers

-   Non Access Modifiers

To use a modifier, you include its keyword in the definition of a class, method,
or variable. The modifier precedes the rest of the statement, as in the
following examples (Italic ones):

```java
public class className {
   // ...
}
private boolean myFlag;
static final double weeks = 9.5;
protected static final int BOXWIDTH = 42;
public static void main(String[] arguments) {
   // body of method
}
```

**Access Control Modifiers:**
-----------------------------

Java provides a number of access modifiers to set access levels for classes,
variables, methods and constructors. The four access levels are:

-   Visible to the package, the default. No modifiers are needed.

-   Visible to the class only (private).

-   Visible to the world (public).

-   Visible to the package and all subclasses (protected).

**Non Access Modifiers:**
-------------------------

Java provides a number of non-access modifiers to achieve many other
functionality.

-   The *static* modifier for creating class methods and variables

-   The *final* modifier for finalizing the implementations of classes, methods,
    and variables.

-   The *abstract* modifier for creating abstract classes and methods.

-   The *synchronized* and *volatile* modifiers, which are used for threads.
