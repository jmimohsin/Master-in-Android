# Android Application Components

Application components are the essential building blocks of an Android application. These components are loosely coupled by the application manifest file AndroidManifest.xml that describes each component of the application and how they interact.

There are following four main components that can be used within an Android application:

Components | Description
---------- | -----------
Activities | They dictate the UI and handle the user interaction to the smartphone screen
Services | They handle background processing associated with an application.
Broadcast Receivers | They handle communication between Android OS and applications.
Content Providers | They handle data and database management issues.

### Activities

An activity represents a single screen with a user interface. For example, an email application might have one activity that shows a list of new emails, another activity to compose an email, and another activity for reading emails. If an application has more than one activity, then one of them should be marked as the activity that is presented when the application is launched.

An activity is implemented as a subclass of **Activity** class as follows:

```kotlin
class MainActivity : Activity {
 
}
```

### Services

A service is a component that runs in the background to perform long-running operations. For example, a service might play music in the background while the user is in a different application, or it might fetch data over the network without blocking user interaction with an activity.

A service is implemented as a subclass of **Service** class as follows:

```kotlin
class MyService : Service {
 
}
```
